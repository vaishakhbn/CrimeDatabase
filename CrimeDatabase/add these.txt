In Database Can you Add these queries?
I don't have MySQL in my laptop.

alter table criminal add column age int (2);

Add these in Jail form :) 


if(checkedListBox1.CheckedItems.Contains("Name")== true)
{
Dim a1 As String
a1 = TextBox2.text
Dim cmd As New Odbc.OdbcCommand("select * from jail where name ='" &a1 &"'" , con)
} 

if(checkedListBox1.CheckedItems.Contains("Section")== true)
{
Dim a1 As Int
a1 = TextBox2.text
Dim cmd As New Odbc.OdbcCommand("select * from jail where caught_under_section ='" &a1 &"'" , con)
} 
if(checkedListBox1.CheckedItems.Contains("Seniority")== true)
{
Dim cmd As New Odbc.OdbcCommand("select * from jail order by begin_date " , con)
} 

Add this query to the Lost And Found Form. Please add a data grid view here also.
Dim cmd As New Odbc.OdbcCommand("select * from lost_found where status = 'not found' "), con)
